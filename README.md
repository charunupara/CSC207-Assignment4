## Experiment 1

For a population size of 10 with 1 cooperator and the rest defector, we predicted that the cooperator will be outnumbered and the average cooperation probability will be close to zero, but there is also a chance for it to be higher since there is one cooperator that can reproduce.

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 0.1**

As expected, in 9 out of 10 experiments, the defectors completely outnumber the cooperators. However, in the sixth run, the single cooperator organism managed to reproduce and the defectors went extinct.

## Experiment 2

For a population size of 100 with 1 cooperator and 99 defector, we also expected that the cooperator be outnumbered and the cooperation probability mean to be close to zero. In this case, there is even a smaller chance that the cooperator can prevail in the end.

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 0.0**

In all 10 runs if this experiment, the defectors completely outnumbered the cooperators, since the ratio between them is much higher as compared to the previous experiment.

## Experiment 3

For 1 defector and the rest cooperators with population size of 10, we expected to see the opposite results from the first part: the defector will be outnumbered and the average cooperation probability will be close to 1, but there is also a chance for it to be lower since there is one defector that can receive energy and reproduce.

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 0.9**

Our prediction was correct: on 9 out of 10 runs of the experiment, the defectors went extinct and the mean cooperation probability was 1.0. We also see a case where the defector was able to reproduce, and the cooperators went extinct instead. That results from the randomness of the simulation.

## Experiment 4

In the larger population size: 1 defector and the rest cooperators with population size of 100, we also expect that the defector will be outnumbered and the average cooperation probability will be close to 1. There is also a much lower chance for it to be lower since the defector to cooperator ratio is very small.

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 1.**

Our prediction was also correct: all 10 of 10 runs of the experiment, the defectors went extinct and the mean cooperation probability was 1.0. Since the ratio of defector to cooperator is minimal, there was no case where the defector was able to reproduce enough to not go extinct. 

## Experiment 5

With population 10 and 3 Cooperators, 3 Defectors and 4 Partial Cooperators, because the partial cooperator cooperates with probability 0.5, we expect to see results that do not follow any specific pattern, since everything is randomized.

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.5

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.5

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 0.5**

We can deduce from the average of means of 0.5 and the number of each organism to conclude that there was indeed no clear pattern and no specific organism prevailed.

## Experiment 6

With population 100 and 33 Cooperators, 33 Defectors and 34 Partial Cooperators, we also expect no clear pattern:

**Results**

1.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.01

2.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.04

3.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.085

4.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

5.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.7

6.Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0

7.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0

8.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.295

9.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.5

10.Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.12


**Average of mean cooperation probabilities: 0.275**

When we increase the number of organisms, we can see that the result does not correspond with the previous experiment. This can be attributed to the randomness of our simulation.


**Conclusion**

If we have a population where the ratio of one type of organism to the other is small, there is little to no chance that the outnumbered one will prevail. However, when the population is evenly divided, then the result doesnâ€™t follow any pattern since the simulation randomizes the outcome.
